CookWare Website
Created a fully responsive cookware website that can be viewed on a desktop, tablet, and mobile phone based off of a prototype Figma given to me.

Peer Review: Gianpaolo Reinares

> Comments: Desktop site looks good.
> Don't know if it was intentional but the Hero Image size doesn't shift when resizing the screen.
> In 'New Arrivals', add some spacing between between the two sections;
> In 'Reviews', make sure the text is solid;
> In the Footer, add some padding/margin as the words are too close to the sides;
> Mobile: Navbar missing collapsable; if you have time, check 'Offcanvas' in the 'Navbar' section of getbootstrap.com;
> Mobile: In 'New Arrivals', add a vertical margin between the sections;
> Mobile: 'Best Sellers' and 'Reviews' need to fill out their space.;
> I would suggest try using a grid for the footer in order to position each section easier.
> Overall the Desktop looks really good aside several nitpicks; try to finish the Mobile to the best of your ability;
